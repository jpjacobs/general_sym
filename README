Implemented:
- V: implemented unionfind
- implemented sym class with
  - create method for making new egraph, where enodes are part of eclasses, and refer to eclassid's of eclasses which they have as arguments.
  - adden method to add enodes, being AR, references to argument eclasses. This is the low-level interface used by add.
  - add, which does the heavy lifting of recursing through AR's, adding (implied) arguments and verbs on the way
    - Does work for hooks and forks (monad and dyad) of named or primitive verbs.

Not yet implemented:
- the add method for:
  - applied conjunctions (e.g. +:@>:)
  - Though applied conjunction, will need extensive separate treatment: explicit definitions
  - modifier trains
- repairing the egraph
- rebuilding the egraph
- applying rewrite rules in the egraph
- ...
